# Custom Process Section Documentation

Successfully added the "How the Custom Process Works" section as the fifth section of the homepage. This section clearly visualizes your 6-step workflow from idea to shipping.

## Features

- **6-Step Timeline**: A clear visual flow:
  1. Send Your Idea
  2. Get Free Mockup & Quote
  3. Confirm Order
  4. Production
  5. Quality Check
  6. Fast Global Shipping
- **Visual Cues**: Each step is Color-coded (Blue -> Purple -> Pink -> Orange -> Green -> Cyan) with corresponding outline icons.
- **Responsive Design**: displaying as a timeline grid that works well on all devices.
- **Call to Action**: A prominent button "Start Your Project Now" leading to the contact page.

## Content Management

The steps are defined in `src/components/custom-process.tsx`. You can edit the text, change colors, or swap icons easily.

### Changing Text
Modify the `title` and `description` fields in the `steps` array.

### Changing Icons
Import new icons from `@heroicons/react/24/outline` and update the `icon` component in the `steps` array.

### Colors
The component uses a `styles` object for each step to define Tailwind classes for borders, text, and backgrounds. This ensures the classes are properly generated by the build system.

## Integration

The section is added to `src/pages/index.tsx` as `<CustomProcess />`, placed after the Real Work section.

## Verification

Visit `http://localhost:3000` and scroll to the bottom. You should see the "Simple 6-Step Workflow" section.
