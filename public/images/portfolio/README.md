# Portfolio Gallery Images

This directory contains comparison images for the "Real Work" portfolio section. Each project should have a "design" proof and a "real" final product photo.

## Required Image Structure

For best results, use pairs of images with the same aspect ratio (4:3 recommended).

## Image Specifications

## How it works

The website is set up to display the "Final Product" by default. When a user hovers over the image, it reveals the "Design Proof" underneath (or vice versa depending on final configuration), allowing them to see the accuracy of the production.
