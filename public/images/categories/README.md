## Current Status:

Until you add actual images, the component will display:
- Gradient background placeholders
- Icon representations for each category
- Smooth hover animations

The design is fully functional and looks great even without images, but adding real product photos will make it even more impressive!

## Tips for Best Results:

1. Use high-quality images with good lighting
2. Show actual neon signs in use (installed/lit up)
3. Keep consistent style across all images
4. Ensure images are well-lit and vibrant
5. Consider using your own product photos for authenticity
